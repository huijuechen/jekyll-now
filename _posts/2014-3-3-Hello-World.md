title: Ways of communication - study on two explanation of immutability
---
From the DSCI 542 lecture, David Laing provided two examples of explanation of immutability in Python. 
Below were my thoughts on the comparison:

Examples given: first one only presented code for one situation, which is “list” is mutable. While the 2nd one gives more complete codes for both mutable “list” and immutable “tuple”. In addition, the 2nd one also provides the way to make a tuple “mutable”, whereas this extended explanation helps the read to better understand the difference, or relationship, between data structure and its label.

Description given: the first one had a long but more top-down explanation at the end of the examples, which, in some cases, can make the readers confused. But the 2nd one started with an analogy, states the purpose of the existence of both kinds of data structure, with the easiness of reading to people without programming background.

Ways of building sentences: the first one has a lot of double negatives, which does not help to make a statement clear. The 2nd one comes with short, clear sentences, makes it digestible.
